If you'd like to help out by\nadding some automated tests for those, that'd be swell. In fact, if you'd\nlike to add any automated tests, you are a winner!\n\n## API\n\n`resolveNestedSelector(selector, node)`\n\nReturns an array of selectors resolved from `selector`.\n\nFor example, given this JS:\n\n```js\nvar resolvedNestedSelector = require('postcss-resolve-nested-selector');\npostcssRoot.eachRule(function(rule) {\n  rule.selectors.forEach(function(selector) {\n    console.log(resolvedNestedSelector(selector, rule));\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAnd the following CSS:\n\n```scss\n.foo {\n  .bar {\n    color: pink;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis should log:\n\n```\n['.foo']\n['.foo .bar']\n```\n\nOr with this CSS:\n\n```scss\n.foo {\n  .bar &,\n  a {\n    color: pink;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis should log:\n\n```\n['.foo']\n['.bar .foo']\n['.foo a']\n```\n",
